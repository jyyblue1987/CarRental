This task involves extracting specific requirements from high-level requirements (or user stories) and then writing code according to the requirements.

A car rental company would like to keep track of their cars. 
They would like you to write a program that stores information about their cars i.e., number, brand, type (Sedan, SUV, Truck etc) and capacity. 
The owners would like to be able to get a list of cars by entering the capacity that their customer wants. 
They also want to have the ability to display all inventory that is in stock at any given time.

Write a class hierarchy and write a CarRental class that stores the information about all the cars. 
Write accessor and mutator functions for all classes (where required). 
Write the driver to test your class. 
You can use any data structure of your choice to store the data and hard-code the data i.e., 
no need for user input for entering car details i.e., number, brand, type etc.

Code can be written in Python or C++.

Requirement Engineering: 
    Write one structured requirement specification in its proper format. 
    There may be more than one requirements in the user story which your code must fulfill but you only need to write 1 requirement specification formally.

Sprints: 
    Think of how you are going to write the code for the above-stated user story. 
    Ideally, you would write down a requirement spec for each requirement. 
    We will be following Agile development. 
    Divide the requirements into two roughly equal chunks. 
    The first half will be completed in sprint 1 and the second half will be completed in sprint 2.

Write a complete test case for the program that you wrote. 
It is important to recall that the requirements you wrote were derived from the user story that you were given. 
For instance, one of the requirements was that the program should display all in stock inventory. 
This also means that when there is no car in stock, an appropriate message is shown. 
Therefore, whenever you are working with test-cases and trying to test your program make sure you think about all possible inputs (large and small, empty, invalid etc) 
that can be thrown at your program within the constraints given in requirements.
